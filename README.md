# qsofinstr v0.0.1 of QSoF
This branch contains the testing version 0 of the transpiler of QSoF. It could compile the `OpenQASM 2.0` files into a graph structured quantum circuit, and it could also laod the quantum circuit from its configuration json file. For now, `qsofinstr v0.0.1` supports compiling quantum circuit into self-designed instruction set that would be sent to FPGA for emulation, test draw of quantum circuit on the console, and the json file that contains the structure configuration of the quantum circuit.
